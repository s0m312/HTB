another note, since user can run as sudo nginx, i had to update the config so it will run a server with root privs, Ippsec walkthrough helped with edit the nginx.conf file,
The updated nginx.conf file:
''''''''
user root;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx2.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;
events {
        worker_connections 768;
}
http {
	server {
		listen 1233;
		location / {
		root /;
		}

	}
}
''''''''''
